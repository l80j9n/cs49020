Coursework Assessment 80% presentation (ppt file + notes): You are required to submit a presentation demonstrating   your    analytical    skills.    Building    on    your    knowledge,    you    will      have    the    opportunity      during   seminars   to   work    on    your    presentation.    The    topic    of    the    presentation    should    cover    the   following: “Using relevant academic literature / theories critically analyse and evaluate a chosen brand by particularly focusing on the customer journey and taking into consideration other relevant marketing management topics” You   should   carefully   consider   your    brand    choice   taking    into    consideration    the   seven    key   marketing management topics. The chosen   marketing management topics should be relevant   to   the   brand   and   properly   connected   to   support   your   arguments   and   analysis.   For   guidance   only   and   to   help   you   choose   the   most   relevant   topics,   you   can   start   by   asking   yourself   the   following questions:
•         Why did you choose   this   brand?   Is   it   a global   brand?
•          Is the chosen   brand successful?   Why?
•         What are the   key   issues/challenges and opportunities facing that   brand?

Although, you will   be   provided with a PowerPoint template to   use, you   can   creatively determine the exact contents of the   presentation.
Please take the following into consideration: 
•          You    must   conduct secondary research;   additional   online    research   uncovering   up   to   date   information   about   the   brand   is   essential   to   enable   you   to   fully   understand   the   big   picture. The   reference   list   must   include the weekly key   readings   discussed   during   lectures in addition to Three NEW, self-sourced academic journal articles focusing on customer experience. You should NEVER use Wikipedia,   blogs, or   other   non-editorial   internet sources.
•          You   must   demonstrate   how you   use   information   rather than   reiterate   what   you   have   learned       (i.e.,       demonstrate criticality in         your          answer       and       a          higher          level       of   understanding of the topic at   hand   using   relevant   key   readings).
•          Please   make   sure   to   use   your   own   words   instead   of   copying   and   pasting   from   various   sources.   You    must    cite    properly   your    sources    using Harvard    style. and    avoid    poor   paraphrasing.
•          Please remember, that for the purpose of   this coursework, there are no right or wrong answers, just   more or   less effective argument, and what   matters is the quality of your   analysis and clarity of   how   you   communicate   it.
20% reflective essay: As   part of your assessment, you   are   required to   write a 1000 - 1500 words reflective essay on the following:
‘Critically reflect on a recent and/or memorable shopping experience in a marketplace or consumption setting. Drawing on relevant academic literature / theories reflectively explore, evaluate, and reflect on this experience.’ 
It   is   important to   be creative and explain your   reflections   in   anyway   you   think   would   be best. You   might find   it   helpful to start working on that   from   week   3   by   keeping   a   reflective      diary or   record   reflective thoughts during   various   lectures each   week to   draw   upon   in   your   reflective essay. 
Assessment    Deadline: Electronic    pdf    file    must    be    submitted   to   the    Moodle    MKTG    227M   submission folder   by Monday 13 Jan 2025 at 3:00pm. The   penalty   for   late   submissions   up   to three   days   is   minus   a   grade   off   your   final   mark   so   a   B   would   be   recorded   as   a   C.

No    extensions      will       be    allowed      for      the      submission      of   coursework   except   in   the   case   of   certified   illness   or   another   substantial   cause.
